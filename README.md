# AltIBMTTSDictionaries
An alternative set of dictionaries for IBMTTS.
Smaller than other dictionaries, but tries to be less agressive about modifying words.
## Standards
Here are some standards I generally like to follow when writing entries for this dictionary, though admittedly some are born out of personal annoyances.
* If a name is written as two separate capitalized words, it won't be added, as screen readers generally split up the string. An exception can be made if the incorrect case is used enough in the real world, however, or if it's a website it can be added if it's used frequently, for example in alt text.
* Don't add words if they are tied to a de-stress, example: identification number.
* If a word sounds different in a dictionary than it does when said in context, how it sounds in context should take priority.
* For name pronunciations, ideally the person with the name should be the source on how to pronounce it, or if that can't be found, secondary sources such as news reports could be consulted. Applies to companies and products as well.
* Don't alter words if the original pronunciation is valid. Exceptions can be made in certain cases, such as detail and identify. While the original pronunciations are correct in some dialects, the version in this dictionary is far, far more popular in actual use.
* Consider the actual sound of the word along with phonetic correctness. I've sometimes changed phonemes, using an x instead of an a, for instance, because there are some phoneme combinations that stress in very irritating ways.
