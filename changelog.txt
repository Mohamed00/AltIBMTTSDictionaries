This is an archive of some pre-GitHub changes to this dictionary set. Unfortunately I only thought to write changelogs recently, so this log is rather limited, but it's still available for historical purposes. Changes going forward will be logged in commits, not here.
9/4/2020.
Removed IT from main as it's too ambiguous.
New main words: Pulseaudio, both capitalized and lowercase.
New root words: cthulhu (uses simplified pronunciation as high level processing of phonemes means that Eloquence cannot approximate Lovecraft's suggested pronunciation), azathoth, beetlejuice, gettysburg, spambot, synthwave, lauda, syntalk, otamatone, macarena, Isaias, dovecote, nevaeh.
9/5/2020.
New words in root: readymade, litecoin, wifi, cryptocoin, iframe, blocklist, ahistoric, ofcom, rootkit, Xperia, wintel, soundwave, pentest, Afroman, anderle, varig.

9/8/2020.
New root words: haves, Remus, Azkaban, blogpost, holo, Mikael, Gómez, trackbar, plegic (para and quadri are roots so entering those forms of the word separately isn't necessary), mailto, shockwave, Kingett, ddemonstrable.
9/9/2020
New root words: livestream, gamedev, automating, Schiphol, Gedalya, Shiite, Yousef, recap.
Removed Andrea as the original Eloquence pronunciation is used by some people. There's also Andrea Communications, the headset manufacturer. May restore it if it turns out the pronunciation I entered in the root is more common.
